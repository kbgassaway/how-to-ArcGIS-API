# ArcGIS API for JavaScript

ArcGIS Online is popular and robust geographic information system (GIS) web program used to create and share maps for all sorts of applications. City planners, business analysts, emergency management, and natural resource managers, just to name a few, often rely on ArcGIS web maps and web apps to analyze geospatial data for their particular use.

An API, or application program interface, is used for building software applications using defined libraries, modules and procedures. The ArcGIS API for JavaScript allows developers to gain access to data, analytical tools, widgets, and create custom layouts and symbology to build interactive map apps.
